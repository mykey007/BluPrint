## Status Page v2
Hi, thanks for your interest in our Front End Engineering position. As part of the interview process we'd like you to build an html status page for an imaginary SAAS application. The zip file includes a file called `history.json` containing the uptime percentage for each hour over the last 30 days for two of their services, the dashboard and the api.

### Your project should
1. Load `history.json` asynchronously in a web browser using javascript
2. Display the current status message for both services
3. Display the historical status data for each service as a chart over the last 30 days
4. Have a user interface allowing you to view just the last 7 days of data
5. Be viewable in the latest versions of Chrome and Firefox
6. Name the imaginary SAAS product

### You should
1. Use any javascript libraries or frameworks you want
2. Write all your own html/css
3. Include instructions on what needs to be done to view your project locally

### It's not required, but your project can
1. Use other languages that compile to javascript (Typescript, Coffeescript, Clojurescript, etc.)
2. Use other languages that compile to css (LESS, Sass, etc.)

### We will evaluate the project based on the following criteria
1. Meeting the project requirements listed above
2. Code quality
3. Style and creativity

Feel free to reach out to us for clarifications. 

Thanks and good luck!
